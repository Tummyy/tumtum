            <p>Dear Danica,</p>
            <p>Hello Nica, how are you, hope you are doing well. If you even read this
                 letter, it is not my intention to annoy you or increase your hatred towards me. This message 
                 is to invite you to go to the Enchanted Kingdom on a (not yet determined) day. If you are not 
                 comfortable with just the two of us, you can go with one of your friends or cousins ​​so that you
                  feel comfortable, I answer all the tickets, commute, and food as long as you bring extra
                   clothes for water activities in case. I will wait for your reply to my email which I will put
                    below or you can block me and tell me your answer. I hope if this is a yes, I will also
                     consider it a yes to the fact that you agree to fix everything between us and show you and 
                     prove to you that I am serious and sincere in everything I say. I understand your hate towards 
                     me, but I hope when we meet again, if you agree, let's enjoy it first and set the anger aside. 
                     This is not just to prove everything to you, but I just want you to enjoy just one day because I know these past few days you have
                      struggled with your academics as well as what I did. Thank you for your time in reading this and I hope 
                      you can see that I want to make something new for you and our relationship that I broke.</p>
            <p>Still loving you,<br>Christian</p>
